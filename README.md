# BNL_2020_Summer_Internship
Used quantum computing to simulate dark energy models and explore features such as stability and tunneling in the potential. Results were determined via the use of Mathematica and IBM's quantum algorithm, the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), available within their Python SDK Qiskit.
